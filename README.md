wpa_gui
=======

wpa_gui from wpa_supplicant - ported to Qt5

I got a good start using a handful of find-and-replaces with sed (see my code repo)
...trial and error for the rest :)

It compiles and works in both Qt4 and Qt5

Original code (qt4): http://hostap.epitest.fi/releases/wpa_supplicant-2.2.tar.gz
